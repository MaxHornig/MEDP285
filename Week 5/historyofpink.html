              The color pink was recognized as a concept in 800 B.C. in Homerâ€™s
              Odyssey. <br />
              The term was coined in the 17th century, first appearing in the
              English dictionaries of the time. <br />
              In the mid-18th century, pink was a preferred color among
              aristocrats, due to the expense of the dye.

            <td>
              In the mid-20th century, men started to wear darker colors. Bright
              and pastel colors like pink were rebranded as feminine.

          <td>            This connotation extended to girls in the 1980s, and then shifted
            back to being somewhat gender neutral in the 2000s and onward.</td>
